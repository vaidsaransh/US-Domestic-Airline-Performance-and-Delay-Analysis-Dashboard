# US-Domestic-Airline-Performance-and-Delay-Analysis-Dashboard


# Description:
This repository contains the code and resources for a data visualization project focusing on analyzing the performance and delay statistics of US domestic airline flights. The project utilizes Python's Dash and Plotly libraries to create interactive dashboards that provide insights into airline operations.

# Key Features:
- Generate yearly airline performance reports, including monthly flight cancellations, average flight times by airline, diverted airport landings, and flight counts by origin and destination state.
- Create annual airline delay reports, showcasing average delay times due to carriers, weather conditions, NAS delays, security issues, and late aircraft.
- Utilize Pandas, Dash, Plotly, and other essential Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and interactivity.
- Develop user-friendly dashboards that allow stakeholders to explore and analyze the data effortlessly.

# Project Structure:
- app.py: The main Python script containing the Dash application code, including layout configuration, callbacks, and data computation functions.
- airline_data.csv: The dataset used for the analysis, containing US domestic airline data.
- README.md: A detailed readme file providing project information, instructions, and usage guidelines.
